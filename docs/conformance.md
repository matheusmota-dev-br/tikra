# Conformance with TikZ

How far tikra is from TikZ itself: every example of the TikZ manual (pgf 3.1.11a) and of the pgfplots
manual (1.18.2), drawn by pdflatex (TeX Live 2025) and by tikra, and compared. How it works and how
to run it: [tools/conformance](../tools/conformance/README.md).

**2330 of 2502 figures (93.1%) match TeX**; 150 are close, 22 differ and 0 fail in tikra. 159 of the ones that do not match came out with no warning.

**Our 100%: 2345 of 2486 (94.3%)**. It leaves out the 16 figures no converter can reproduce (9 with random numbers TeX draws anew on every run, 3 with an image file or external program, 4 with the day's date), and counts as done 18 that differ only by antialiasing. The list, checked by eye: [unreproducible.json](../tools/conformance/unreproducible.json).

| | Figures | Match | Close | Different | Fails | Mean F1 |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| All | 2502 | 2330 (93.1%) | 150 (6.0%) | 22 (0.9%) | 0 (0.0%) | 0.98 |
| TikZ manual | 1864 | 1720 (92.3%) | 130 (7.0%) | 14 (0.8%) | 0 (0.0%) | 0.98 |
| pgfplots manual | 638 | 610 (95.6%) | 20 (3.1%) | 8 (1.3%) | 0 (0.0%) | 0.99 |

*Match*: same shape (F1 ≥ 0.9 on the edges, with 0.5 mm of tolerance), no missing or extra piece, the same colors and size. *Close*: F1 ≥ 0.75.
*Fails*: tikra returned an error, panicked or took more than 10 s. Mean F1 counts a failure as 0.

Not counted: 137 where tex could not compile it, 19 where tex draws nothing visible, and 479 examples that are not figures (text, tables, key listings).

## Speed

The same 192 figures (a fixed sample of the manuals), one at a time, on Darwin arm64:

| | Median per figure | p95 |
|---|---:|---:|
| pdflatex (texlive/texlive:latest) | 647 ms | 1031 ms |
| tikra, TikZ to SVG | 0.83 ms | 7.51 ms |

Median ratio: tikra is **844× faster**. pdflatex time includes starting TeX and loading the libraries of the manual, which is what a user
waits for; tikra's is the conversion inside a running process: the first figure of a process also builds the engine, 13.0 ms more.

## By chapter

Sorted by how many figures do not match, the work left.
