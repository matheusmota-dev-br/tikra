    ``animate=True`` adds the construction animation: in a browser, the figure draws itself path by
    path, in the order TikZ drew it. ``steps=True`` numbers each element by its step instead
    (``data-step``, and ``data-steps`` on the ``<svg>``), with no CSS, for a page that walks through
    the figure itself. ``source=True`` numbers them and adds the place in the code that drew each
    one (``data-src="line:column-line:column"``, from 1).
